#Overview

Create a simple facebook application with Ruby on Rails, PHP, or Python (preferably rails). That does the following.

1. Authenticates the user with basic facebook permissions.

2. Upon login display some personal information.

3. Create a local leader-board based on an arbitrary rank. (Assign points to users)

Don't spend any time on styling. Ask me for a pull request and then start pushing early and often.
