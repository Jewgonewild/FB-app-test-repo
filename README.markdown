#Overview

Create a simple facebook application with Ruby on Rails, PHP, or Python. That does the following:

1. Authenticates the user with basic facebook permissions.

2. Upon login display some personal information.

3. Create a local leader-board (Your friends) based on an arbitrary rank. (Assign points to users)

Don't spend any time on styling. Ask me for a pull request and then start pushing early and often.
