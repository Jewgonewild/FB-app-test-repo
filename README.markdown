Create a simple facebook application with Ruby on Rails, PHP, or Python. That does the following:

Important: Please use an established framework (CakePHP, CodeIgniter, Rails, Django) 

1. Authenticates the user with basic facebook permissions.

2. Upon login display a user's friend wall or list (basically photos of the user's friend).

3. On hover show some basic stats about the user (make sure the tooltip is built with jquery)

4. Once this is all ready, deploy it to an AWS instance.

Don't spend any time on styling. Ask me for a pull request and then start pushing early and often.
